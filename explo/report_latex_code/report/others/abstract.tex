{

Predicting problem-prone components before the testing stage of the software development process is the goal of software defect prediction studies. The most significant advantage of these prediction models is that additional testing resources may be properly devoted to fault-prone modules. While a few software defect prediction models have been created, there is still a need for a thorough review of these findings. As a result, we conducted a study to assess how machine learning has been used to predict software faults.
